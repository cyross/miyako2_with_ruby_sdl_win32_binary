1 What's Ruby/SDL

Ruby/SDL is the ruby extension library to use SDL.
SDL(Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a cross-platform multimedia library      
designed to provide fast access to the graphics framebuffer and audio    
device. See http://www.libsdl.org/ if you want to know SDL in detail.

2 Platform
This library supports 
Linux on X,Win32,FreeBSD and BeOS.

3 Library Needed

Ruby/SDL needs Ruby and SDL and optionally uses SDL_image,SDL_mixer,
SDL_ttf, SGE, OpenGL  and SMPEG.

Indispensable
Ruby   http://www.ruby-lang.org/
SDL   http://www.libsdl.org/

Optional
SDL_mixer   http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/index.html
SDL_ttf   http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/index.html
SDL_image   http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/index.html
SGE   http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~e8cal1/sge/
SMPEG  http://www.icculus.org/smpeg/
SDLSKK http://www.kmc.gr.jp/~ohai/sdlskk.en.html

4 INSTALL

install on FreeBSD
Use Port.

install on Linux
(1)install Ruby
  See Ruby's document and install.
(2)install SDL
  Extract SDL's source and run './configure' with '--disable-pthreads'
  option.
  On Linux using pthread with Ruby/SDL makes problem.
  You can avoid this problem by other way (Please see rubysdl_doc.en.rd).
  And run 'make','make install'.

(3)install SGE
  Run 'make' and 'make install'.
  
(4)install SDL_mixer, SDL_ttf, SDL_image, SMPEG and SDLSKK
  See documents of these libraries and install them .

(5)install this extension library,Ruby/SDL
  Run 'ruby extconf.rb','make' and 'make install'.

5 USE Ruby/SDL
  Write "require 'sdl'" in your Ruby script.
  See following documents and samples if you want to know the detail.

  sample/*.rb
    Ruby/SDL samples.In some script, you have to prepare data such as
    "sample.wav" and "sample.mpg".
  rubysdl_doc.en.rd
    Simple reference manual
  document of SDL
    This is in SDL archive.
    Please read this when you want to know what does't describe
    these documents.

6 OpenGL
  You can use OpenGL with this library.

  (1) Setup OpenGL and SDL.
  (2) Get OpenGL Interface (http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/opengl/)
  (3) Install OpenGL Interface
  (4) Run "ruby extconf.rb" with "--enable-opengl".
  (5) Run "make" and "make install"
  (6) Write "require 'sdl'; require 'opengl'"  in your script.

  The interface of OpenGL is same as "OpenGL Interface".
  Please see SDL's document,OpenGL document and sample/testgl.rb .

  Each OpenGL implementation are a little different in API, so
  you may fail to compile Ruby's OpenGL Interface. If you can't
  compile, but if you want to complile it, you should modify
  sources.

7 LICENSE
  This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2.1 or later,
  which can be found in the file "LICENSE".
  But samples, the Ruby scripts sample/*.rb, are not under LGPL, and
  you can use their files freely.
